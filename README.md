# COOP Training Projects  

This repository is for my training projects during COOP.  
I’m still a beginner and I use this repo to practice, try new things, and keep track of what I’m learning.  

Right now, I only have a few small projects, but I’ll be adding more as I continue learning.  

These are not final projects, just practice work.
